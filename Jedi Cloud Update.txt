This version of the code in your comment works for me:

InputStream inputStream = file.getContents();

StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();

// Copy to string, use the file's encoding
IOUtils.copy(inputStream, writer, file.getCharset());

// Done with input
inputStream.close();

String theString = writer.toString();

theString = theString + " added";

// Get bytes using the file's encoding
byte[] bytes = theString.getBytes(file.getCharset());

InputStream source = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);

file.setContents(source, IResource.FORCE, null);
Note the close of the original input stream and the use of file.getCharset() to use the correct encoding.  Parse.Cloud.define("test", function(request, response) {
   Parse.JediCloud.useMasterKey();
   var query = new Parse.Query(Parse.User);
   query.equalTo("objectId", request.params.objectId);
   query.first({
      success: function(object) {
         object.set("name", request.params.name);
         object.save();
         response.success("Success Message");
      },
      error: function(error) {
         response.error("Error Message");
      }
   });
});
  Parse.Cloud.define("test", function(request, response) {
   Parse.JediCloud.useMasterKey();
   var query = new Parse.Query(Parse.User);
   query.equalTo("objectId", request.params.objectId);
   query.first({
      success: function(object) {
         object.set("name", request.params.name);
         object.save();
         response.success("Success Message");
      },
      error: function(error) {
         response.error("Error Message");
      }
   });

NIST View of Cloud Computing

NIST promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing
measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance
economic security and improve quality of life

? Cloud computing: A model for enabling
convenient, on-demand network access to a
shared pool of configurable computing resources
(e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
and services) that can be rapidly provisioned
and released with minimal management effort or
service provider interaction
? This cloud model promotes availability and is
composed of five essential characteristics,
three service models, and four deployment
models

5 Essential Cloud Characteristics
? On-demand self-service
? Broad network access
? Resource pooling
? Location independence
? Rapid elasticity
? Measured service

Measured Service: Utility Computing
? “Computing may someday be organized as a
public utility” – John McCarthy, MIT,1961
? “Packaging of computing resources, such as
computation and storage, as a metered service
similar to a traditional public utility, such as
electricity”

3 Cloud Service Models
? Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS)
? Use provider’s applications over a network
? Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS)
? Deploy customer-created applications to a cloud
? Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
? Rent processing, storage, network capacity, and other
fundamental computing resources
? To be considered “cloud” they must be deployed on
top of cloud infrastructure that has the key
characteristics

Google App Engine (GAE)
? Google’s approach to CC
? “Google as the web platform”
? A platform to deploy and host web applications in
Google-managed data centers
? GAE delivers a platform and solution stack (as a
service) ? PaaS
? GAE virtualizes apps across multiple servers and
data centers
? Beta service since 2008

GAE vs. AWS
? GAE is PaaS
? Abstract OS-independent platform is pre-built and
provided
? Users have to create a web app and deploy it to the
abstract platform
? AWS is IaaS
? Users can build their own platform within CC, called
AMI ? “Infrastructure as a Service”
? Users can create a web app and deploy it to their own
platform (AMI)

4 Cloud Deployment Models
? Private or internal cloud
? enterprise owned/leases, for internal purpose
? Community cloud
? shared infrastructure for community
? Public cloud
? For general public, mega-scale infrastructure
? Hybrid cloud
? composition of two or more clouds 
Eg, Private Cloud

Eg, Community Cloud

s
“Gov Cloud”
Eg, Public Cloud
26 
Eg, Hybrid Cloud
27
? Use multiple deployment models together
? Eg
? Move enterprise level apps to private cloud and
less critical apps to public cloud

Putting All Together
? Most clouds will require very strong security
controls
? All models of cloud may be used for differing
tradeoffs between threat exposure and
efficiency
? There is no one “cloud”
? There are many models and architectures
? How does one choose? 
32
Effects of Cloud Computing
? Small enterprises use public SaaS and public
clouds and minimize growth of data centers
? Large enterprise data centers may evolve to act as
private clouds
? Large enterprises may use hybrid cloud
infrastructure software to leverage both internal and
public clouds
? Public clouds may adopt standards in order to run
workloads from competing hybrid cloud
infrastructures 
Issues of Cloud Computing
? Privacy
? Security
? Legal Issue
? Compliance
? Availability
? Performance

Sunny Thoughts on CC
? Tim O'Reilly, CEO O'Reilly Media
?
“I think it is one of the foundations of the next
generation of computing”
?
“The network of networks is the platform for all
computing”
“Everything we think of as a 
computer today is really just a 
device that connects to the big 
computer that we are all 
collec:vely building”
39
? Sun Microsystems CTO Greg Papadopoulos
? Users will “trust” service providers with their data
like they trust banks with their money
?
“Hosting providers [will] bring ?brutal efficiency'
for utilization, power, security, service levels, and
idea-to-deploy time” –CNET article
? Becoming cost ineffective to build data centers
? Organizations will rent computing resources
Sunny Thoughts on CC 
Criticisms on Cloud Computing
? Richard Stallman (GNU, FSF, Emacs)
? cloud computing was simply a trap aimed at
forcing more people to buy into locked, proprietary
systems that would cost them more and more
over time
? Larry Ellison (Oracle CEO)
?
“everything that we already do" and that it will
have no effect except to "change the wording on
some of our ads”

Case: NYT and Nasdaq (4/08)
? New York Times
? Didn't coordinate with Amazon, used a credit card!
? Used EC2 and S3 to convert 15 million scanned news
articles to PDF (4TB data)
? Took 100 Linux computers 24 hours (would have taken
months on NYT computers
? Nasdaq
? Uses S3 to deliver historic stock and fund information
? Millions of files showing price changes of entities over 10
minute segments
?
“The expenses of keeping all that data online [in Nasdaq
servers] was too high.” – Claude Courbois, Nasdaq VP
? Created lightweight Adobe AIR application to let users view
data
